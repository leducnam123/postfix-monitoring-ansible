# Postfix Monitoring Ansible Demo

## Description
This demo sets up:
- Postfix on Ubuntu 22.04
- Bash-based Postfix queue exporter for Prometheus
- Sample Prometheus config for scraping metrics

## How to run
1. Update `inventory/hosts.ini` with your server IP and user.
2. Run playbook:
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts.ini playbook.yml
3. Check exporter service: systemctl status postfix_exporter
4. Add prometheus_sample.yml to your Prometheus server to scrape metrics.

## Notes

The exporter script runs as systemd service. Metrics are exposed in Prometheus format.
